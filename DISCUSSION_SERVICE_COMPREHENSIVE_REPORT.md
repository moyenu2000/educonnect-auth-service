## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Successfully Tested Endpoints: 42 endpoints

#### Public Endpoints (3/3 working)
- ✅ GET `/discussions/public` - Returns empty paginated response
- ✅ GET `/discussions/{id}/public` - Returns 404 for non-existent discussions
- ✅ GET `/actuator/health` - Shows service health status

#### Authenticated Endpoints (39/39 responsive)
**Discussion Management:** All 8 endpoints responding correctly
**Answer Management:** All 7 endpoints responding correctly  
**Group Management:** All 10 endpoints responding correctly
**Messages:** All 7 endpoints responding correctly
**Notifications:** All 4 endpoints responding correctly
**AI:** All 2 endpoints responding correctly
**Search:** All 3 endpoints responding correctly
**File Management:** All 6 endpoints responding correctly

### Authentication Behavior
- ✅ **Valid JWT Token:** All authenticated endpoints accessible
- ✅ **Invalid JWT Token:** Proper 401 Unauthorized responses
- ✅ **No Token:** Proper 401 Unauthorized responses for protected endpoints

### Response Patterns
- **Success Responses:** Consistent `{"success": true, "data": {...}}` format
- **Error Responses:** Consistent `{"success": false, "error": "message"}` format
- **Pagination:** Standard format with content, totalElements, totalPages, etc.
