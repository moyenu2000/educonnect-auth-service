# Fix for Messaging System User Display Issue

## Problem
The messaging system was showing your name instead of other users' names in conversations because:

1. **Missing User Data in localStorage**: The messaging components were trying to get the current user ID from `localStorage.getItem('user')`, but the user object was never stored in localStorage.

2. **Only Tokens Stored**: The authentication system was only storing `accessToken` and `refreshToken` in localStorage, not the actual user data.

3. **Components Not Using AuthContext**: The messaging components weren't using the React AuthContext that contained the user information.

## Root Cause
- **MessageList.tsx**, **ConversationList.tsx**, **MessagingInterface.tsx**, and **MessageItem.tsx** all call `getCurrentUserId()` which tries to parse `localStorage.getItem('user')`
- This always returned `null` because no user data was stored
- Without proper user ID identification, the `isOwn` comparison in messages failed
- This caused all messages to show incorrect sender names

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated AuthContext.tsx
- **loadCurrentUser()**: Now stores user data in localStorage when loading current user
- **login()**: Now stores user data in localStorage on successful login  
- **logout()**: Now removes user data from localStorage on logout
- **updateUser()**: Now updates user data in localStorage when user is updated

### 2. Updated authService.ts
- **login()**: Now stores user data if returned in response
- **refreshToken()**: Now stores user data if returned in response
- **verify2FA()**: Now stores user data if returned in response
- **clearAuth()**: Now removes user data from localStorage

### 3. Added Debug Logs
- **MessageList.tsx**: Added console.log to show current user ID
- **MessageItem.tsx**: Added console.log to show message sender and ownership

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear Browser Storage**: Clear localStorage to start fresh
2. **Login**: Login to the application - user data should now be stored
3. **Check Console**: Look for debug logs showing:
   - "Current user ID: [number]" in MessageList
   - "Message from: [name] isOwn: [true/false] senderName: [name]" in MessageItem
4. **Test Messaging**: 
   - Open messaging interface
   - Check if your messages show "You" 
   - Check if other users' messages show their actual names
   - Verify conversation list shows other participants correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Your Messages**: Should display "You" as sender name
- **Other Users' Messages**: Should display their actual full name or username
- **Conversation List**: Should show other participants' names correctly
- **Message Ownership**: Should correctly identify which messages are yours vs others

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
2. `/frontend/src/services/authService.ts` 
3. `/frontend/src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx`
4. `/frontend/src/components/messaging/MessageItem.tsx`

The fix ensures that user data is consistently stored in localStorage whenever authentication state changes, allowing messaging components to correctly identify the current user and display names appropriately.
