- **Authentication**: ✅ WORKING - JWT token validation working
- **Service Health**: ✅ UP - All components healthy

## Test Results by Category

### ✅ WORKING ENDPOINTS

#### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
- `GET /api/v1/test/public` - ✅ Working
- `GET /api/v1/test/jwt-config` - ✅ Working

#### Subject Management
- `GET /api/v1/subjects` - ✅ Working (returns 5 subjects)
- `GET /api/v1/subjects/{id}` - ✅ Expected to work
- `GET /api/v1/subjects?page=0&size=5` - ✅ Expected to work

#### Basic Database Queries
- Subject and topic retrieval endpoints should work now that DB is fixed

### ❌ IDENTIFIED ISSUES

#### Analytics Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard` - ❌ Failing with generic error
- Other analytics endpoints likely affected

#### Public Endpoints with Database Queries
- `GET /api/v1/subjects/public` - ❌ Was failing (need to retest)
- `GET /api/v1/topics/public/by-subject/{id}` - ❌ Was failing (need to retest)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Complete comprehensive testing of all endpoints
   - Identify specific error patterns
   - Check application logs for detailed error messages

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Database connectivity was the main issue (FIXED)
   - Some endpoints may have specific implementation issues
   - Authentication and JWT validation is working correctly

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Run complete endpoint test suite
   - Fix any remaining database query issues
   - Verify all CRUD operations work
