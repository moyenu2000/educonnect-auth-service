## Security Features

### Authentication Patterns:
- **JWT-based authentication** across all services
- **Role-based access control** with method-level security
- **Public endpoints** for essential operations
- **Cross-service user synchronization**

### Authorization Levels:
1. **Public Access** - No authentication required
2. **Authenticated Access** - Valid JWT token required
3. **Role-Based Access** - Specific role permissions required
4. **Owner-Based Access** - Resource ownership validation

### Key Security Considerations:
- All sensitive operations require authentication
- Admin functions are properly segregated
- Question setters have limited administrative access
- Students have access to learning features only
- Public endpoints provide essential browsing capabilities
- WebSocket endpoints require authentication
- File access includes ownership validation
